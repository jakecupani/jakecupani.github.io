/*
 * The 'express.static' middleware provides some services Express can use to
 * serve files from a directory - in this case, the 'public' subdirectory of
 * this project.
 *
 * The 'app.use' function attaches middleware to our Express application, so
 * that when the application is running, it can serve static files. In this
 * case, we mount it over the entire app: any web request that GETs a path that
 * exists in the 'public' directory will be handled by the middleware. The
 * middleware also serves the 'index.html' file in a directory (if it exists)
 * whenever a client requests the directory itself.
 *
 * The 'public' directory for this project, in turn, contains all the HTML,
 * Javascript, and CSS files needed to run a simple chat client connected to
 * this server. Accessing this server's root URL will serve 'public/index.html',
 * which contains our chat client. This gives users an easy way to connect to
 * the server and interact with other users.
