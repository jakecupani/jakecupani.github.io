Hello, my name is [NAME]. I graduated in May of 2022 with my Masters in Information Management and Data Analytics from UMD, and my Bachelor’s in Information Science with a specialization in Data Science and a minor in Astronomy from UMD. Currently, I work as a Data Analytics Consultant at CTI Data.

Although my academic studies focused mainly on Data Science, I also spent a lot of time learning and gaining experience in the field of Web Development. My first internship with NASA in 2018 was at the Goddard Library, where my duties were to help the Library in their effort to migrate their PHP website to a Drupal 8. During my internship, I created wireframes for the new website, learned how to use Drupal 8 and PHP, and wrote HTML content for the website.

My second internship at NASA was with my mentor Rebecca Derro, who is the manager of the Systems Engineering Educational Development Program (SEED) at Goddard. The SEED Program is a professional development program that aims to provide budding Systems Engineers with an educational plan of competencies required to be a successful Systems Engineer. I was tasked with creating a web application using the Python Django framework that could visualize these competencies of System’s Engineers in the SEED Program. At the beginning of my internship in 2019, I had no experience with the Django web framework, so I had to teach myself the entire Django framework from the ground up using online tutorials and Django documentation as my guide. As a Software Engineer, it is a crucial skill to be able to adapt to new technologies and learn as you go. In this internship, I conducted user tests, developed wireframes, created Entity Relationship Diagrams for the database, and created visualizations using D3 JS. By the end of my internship, my mentor was beyond proud of my work and even wanted to have my work submitted for a NASA patent. 

During my final NASA internship, I worked as a Data Scientist for the Mars Sample Return team at NASA HQ with my mentor Richard Ryan. I created data visualizations in Tableau and Power BI for the Mars Sample Return team in order to forecast financial data related to the Mars Sample Return project. This internship was very special to me because it allowed me to be a part of a mission that I find very fascinating.

Aside from my NASA experience, during my academic career, I also served as a Teaching Assistant for classes in the school of Information Science in User Experience Design and Dynamic Web Applications. My work as a Teaching Assistant was a great way for me to not only practice my web development skills, but also help others in the process, which I find very rewarding.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to talking with you in the future. If you would like to know more about my experience you can find my resume on my website at
