**Privacy Policy**

**Our Commitment to Your Privacy**

Motiquote respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle the information we collect when you use our Apple Vision Pro application.

**Information We Collect**

The App does not collect any personal information. This means we do not gather data that could directly identify you, such as:

* Your name
* Email address
* Location
* Device identifiers
* Contacts
* Usage data

**How We Use Information**

* **Providing the App's Services**: The only purpose of the App is to display famous quotes. No information is used outside the context of delivering this functionality within the App itself.

**Third-party Sharing**

The App does not share any information with third parties.

**Security**

Since the App does not collect sensitive data, standard Apple Vision Pro application security measures apply. The data storage of quotes (if you decide to keep any locally) falls under Apple's secure enclave system within the user's device.

**Data Retention**

If you choose to implement local storage for any reason (such as preserving a list of favorites), please be transparent about this and your approach to data retention in this section. Since this is a non-essential feature for this type of app, it's likely best left unimplemented.

**Updates to the Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy. If so, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy.
