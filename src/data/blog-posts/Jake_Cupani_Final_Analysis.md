# What years had the highest and lowest frequency of meteorite landings in past and present?

<b>Past: any year between 1900 and 1950 <br>
Present: any year after 1990</b>

Bar plots were used in this case to show the frequency of meteorite landings since we want to see how many times they happened over the years.


```python
# Present

df['year'][df['year'] >= 1990].value_counts().plot(kind = 'bar', title = 'Present Frequencies of Meteorite Landings by Year')

print("As we can see from the graph, 2003 had the highest frequency of meteorite landings, while 2013 had the least.")
```

    As we can see from the graph, 2003 had the highest frequency of meteorite landings, while 2013 had the least.

# In what areas of the world were meteorite landings most common? Does the distribution change over the years?

By using a scatter plot on top of a world map, it allows us to easily see where a majority of the meteorite landings happened.


```python
def plot_meteorites(df,title):
  geometry = [Point(xy) for xy in zip(df['reclong'], df['reclat'])]
  gdf = GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=geometry)   

  world = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))
  gdf.plot(ax=world.plot(figsize=(10, 6)), marker='o', color='red', markersize=3)

  plt.suptitle(title)

As we can see, there's a general trend of meteorites landing in the western US, Peru, Northern Africa, Southern Australia, and parts of Europe. Another trend that I noticed is that there seem to be less meteorites in the 2010s than in the other decades.

# What is the distribution of masses amongst all of the meteorites?

> Indented block




```python
df['mass'][df['mass'] < 250].plot(kind='box')
```

```python
print("As we can see in the distribution plot, the distribution is highly skewed to the right with a majority of the values below 500 grams.")
print("We can also say that the distribution is unimodal.")
print("There are",len(df[df['mass'] > 250]),"clear outliers that I will remove from my histogram to show the general distribution.")
print()

# sns.displot(df[df['mass'] < 2000], x="mass")
sns.displot(df[df['mass'] < 250], x="mass")

plt.title("Distribution of Meteorite Masses (Fig. 5)")

```

    As we can see in the distribution plot, the distribution is highly skewed to the right with a majority of the values below 500 grams.
    We can also say that the distribution is unimodal.
    There are 7182 clear outliers that I will remove from my histogram to show the general distribution.

print()

mass_df = df[df['mass'] < 250]

plot_meteorites(mass_df,"Normal Mass Meteorites (<250g) (Fig. 6)")

    Looks like the more 'normal' mass meteorites are distributed evenly across the world.

print()

mass_df = df[df['mass'] > 2000]

plot_meteorites(mass_df,"Large Mass Meteorites (>2000g) (Fig. 7)")

    There seem to be more large mass meteorites in Southern Africa, the US, and parts of South America.

# What differences are there in the masses of Northern vs. Southern Hemisphere meteorites?

The bar chart shows the average mass of meteorites for the northern and southern hemispheres respectively.


```python
print("Here we show the average mass of Northern vs Southern Hemisphere meteorites.")
print("It is interesting to see that Northern Hemisphere meteorites have a higher average mass.")
print()

hemisphere_bar = sns.barplot(x="hemisphere", y="mass", data=df,ci=None)
plt.title("Northern vs. Southern Hemisphere Meteorite Masses (Fig. 8)")
```

    Here we show the average mass of Northern vs Southern Hemisphere meteorites.
    It is interesting to see that Northern Hemisphere meteorites have a higher average mass.
    
    




    Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Northern vs. Southern Hemisphere Meteorite Masses (Fig. 8)')




    
![png](output_26_2.png)
    



```python
# Is there any statistically significant difference in the masses of Northern vs Southern Hemisphere meteorites?

# H0: There is no difference between the masses of meteorites in the hemispheres. (avg difference 0).
# HA: There is a difference between the masses of meteorites in the hemispheres. (avg difference != 0).

northern = df[df['hemisphere'] == 'Northern']
southern = df[df['hemisphere'] == 'Southern']

north_mass = northern['mass']
south_mass = southern['mass']

# Point Estimate
mass_pe = north_mass.mean() - south_mass.mean()
print("The point estimate is:",mass_pe)

# Degree of Freedom
deg_freedom = len(north_mass) if len(north_mass) < len(south_mass) else len(south_mass)
deg_freedom = deg_freedom - 1
print("The degrees of freedom is:",deg_freedom)

# Standard Error
north_se = north_mass.std()**2/len(north_mass)
south_se = south_mass.std()**2/len(south_mass)

mass_se = sqrt(north_se + south_se)
print("The standard error is:",mass_se)

# 5. Calculate the t score and the p-value.
mass_t = (mass_pe - 0)/mass_se
print("The t score is:",mass_t)

mass_p = stats.distributions.t.sf(mass_t,deg_freedom)
print("The p value is:",mass_p)

print("Therefore, since the p-value is less than an alpha of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the masses of meteorites in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.")
```

    The point estimate is: 32648.79079167894
    The degrees of freedom is: 8258
    The standard error is: 10687.521940131997
    The t score is: 3.054851346698214
    The p value is: 0.001129450442007376
    Therefore, since the p-value is less than an alpha of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the masses of meteorites in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.
    

# Key Points

As we can see from the analysis done above, there are some noteable points that we have learned from this dataset.



*   1998 had the highest frequency of meteorite landings, while 2013 had the least in the last three decades.
*   1937 had the highest frequency of meteorite landings, while 1901 had the least in the early 1900s.
*   The distribution of masses is unimodal and highly skewed to the right with a majority of the values below 250 grams.
*   Meteorites are mainly found along the 25 and -25 degree latitude lines.
*   There's a general trend of meteorites landing in the western US, Southern America, Norther Africa, Southern Austrailia, and parts of Europe. Another trend that I noticed is that there seem to be less meteorites in the 2010s than in the other decades.
