## Motivation

The heart of my research project comes from my understanding and passion for
Astronomy. In fact, in my undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland, I minored
in Astronomy and interned at NASA Goddard for two years. Due to these experiences, I
thought that this class project would be a great opportunity to apply the statistical
methods learned in class to some real world astronomical data from NASA. Meteorites
are much more than just space rocks, they can provide us with crucial information about
everything from solar system formation to the origins of life on Earth (American Museum
of Natural History, n.d.). Furthermore, according to the Planetary Science Institute,
approximately 500 meteorites land on the Earth‚Äôs surface every year with only 10
recovered (Planetary Science Institute, 2019). This approximation tells us that there
must be plenty of meteorites still to be discovered, which means there‚Äôs still lots of
insights yet to be made from meteorites. These factors are what inspired me to pursue
this project.

## Project Summary 

The goal of this project is to identify the frequency of meteorite landings
throughout different time periods, most common geographic regions of meteorites, and
the differences between meteorite landings in the northern and southern hemispheres
respectively. The goal of this project would be an analytical pipeline to identify trends in
meteorite landings and their respective geographical locations.

## About the Data

The dataset for my analysis is the Meteorite Landings dataset developed by
NASA. The data was downloaded directly from [NASA‚Äôs Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/meteorite-landings) (NASA &
Kaggle, 2016). The dataset is also directly available from [NASA‚Äôs Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh). The data
was in normal Comma Separated Value format (CSV), which made it relatively easy to
import into Python. There were also over 45,000 rows of data, which provided the
analysis with plenty of samples to work with. The programming for this analysis was
done [via Google Colab for easy access](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg).

## Data Analysis

### What years had the highest and lowest frequency of meteorite landings in past and present?

**Past:** any year between 1900 and 1950

**Present:** any year after 1990

Bar plots were used in this case to show the frequency of meteorite landings since we want to see how many times they happened over the years.

```python
# Present
df['year'][df['year'] >= 1990].value_counts().plot(kind = 'bar', title = 'Present Frequencies of Meteorite Landings by Year')
```

As we can see from the graph, 2003 had the highest frequency of meteorite landings, while 2013 had the least.

![Graph 1](/assets/meteorite-landings/1.png)

As we can see from the graph, 2003 had the highest frequency of meteorite landings, while 2013 had the least.

```python
present = df['year'][df['year'] >= 1990].value_counts()
present = pd.DataFrame(present).reset_index()
.rename(columns={"index": "year", "year": "frequency"}).sort_values(by=['year'])

present.plot(x ='year', y='frequency', kind = 'line')
plt.suptitle("Present Frequencies of Meteorite Landings (Fig. 1)")
```

![Graph 2](/assets/meteorite-landings/2.png)

```python
df['year'][(df['year'] <= 1950) & (df['year'] >= 1900)].value_counts()
.plot(kind='bar', title='Bar plot of Year')
```

As we can see from the graph, 1937 had the highest frequency of meteorite landings, while 1901 had the least.

![Graph 3](/assets/meteorite-landings/3.png)

```python
past = df['year'][(df['year'] <= 1950) & (df['year'] >= 1900)].value_counts()
past = pd.DataFrame(past).reset_index().rename(columns={"index": "year", "year": "frequency"}).sort_values(by=['year'])
past.plot(x ='year', y='frequency', kind = 'line')
plt.suptitle("Past Frequencies of Meteorite Landings (Fig. 2)")
```

![Graph 4](/assets/meteorite-landings/4.png)

### In what areas of the world were meteorite landings most common? Does the distribution change over the years?

```python
def plot_meteorites(df,title):
  geometry = [Point(xy) for xy in zip(df['reclong'], df['reclat'])]
  gdf = GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=geometry)   

  world = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))
  gdf.plot(ax=world.plot(figsize=(10, 6)), marker='o', color='red', markersize=3)

  plt.suptitle(title)

# All Meteorites
plot_meteorites(df,"All Meteorites (Fig. 3)")
```

![Graph 5](/assets/meteorite-landings/5.png)

```python
# Past Meteorites
past_m = df[(df['year'] <= 1950) & (df['year'] >= 1900)]
plot_meteorites(past_m, "Past Meteorites (Fig. 3)")
```

![Graph 6](/assets/meteorite-landings/6.png)

```python
# Present Meteorites
present_m = df[df['year'] >= 1990]
plot_meteorites(present_m, "Present Meteorites (Fig. 4)")
```

![Graph 7](/assets/meteorite-landings/7.png)

```python
# 90s Meteorites
df_90 = df[(df['year'] >= 1990) & (df['year'] <= 1999)]
plot_meteorites(df_90, "90s Meteorites")
```

![Graph 8](/assets/meteorite-landings/8.png)

```python
# 00s Meteorites
df_00 = df[(df['year'] >= 2000) & (df['year'] <= 2009)]
plot_meteorites(df_00,"2000s Meteorites")
```

![Graph 9](/assets/meteorite-landings/9.png)

```python
# 10s Meteorites
df_10 = df[(df['year'] >= 2010) & (df['year'] <= 2019)]
plot_meteorites(df_10,"2010s Meteorites")
```

![Graph 10](/assets/meteorite-landings/10.png)

As we can see, there's a general trend of meteorites landing in the western US, Peru, Northern Africa, Southern Australia, and parts of Europe. Another trend that I noticed is that there seem to be less meteorites in the 2010s than in the other decades.

### What is the distribution of masses amongst all of the meteorites?

```python
df['mass'][df['mass'] < 250].plot(kind='box')
```

![Graph 11](/assets/meteorite-landings/11.png)

As we can see in the distribution plot, the distribution is highly skewed to the right with a majority of the values below 500 grams.

We can also say that the distribution is unimodal. There are 7182 clear outliers that I will remove from my histogram to show the general distribution.

![Graph 12](/assets/meteorite-landings/12.png)

```python
mass_df = df[df['mass'] < 250]
plot_meteorites(mass_df,"Normal Mass Meteorites (<250g) (Fig. 6)")
```

Looks like the more 'normal' mass meteorites are distributed evenly across the world.

![Graph 13](/assets/meteorite-landings/13.png)

```python
mass_df = df[df['mass'] > 2000]
plot_meteorites(mass_df,"Large Mass Meteorites (>2000g) (Fig. 7)")
```

There seem to be more large mass meteorites in Southern Africa, the US, and parts of South America.

![Graph 14](/assets/meteorite-landings/14.png)

### What differences are there in the masses of Northern vs. Southern Hemisphere meteorites?

The bar chart shows the average mass of meteorites for the northern and southern hemispheres respectively.

```python
hemisphere_bar = sns.barplot(x="hemisphere", y="mass", data=df,ci=None)
plt.title("Northern vs. Southern Hemisphere Meteorite Masses (Fig. 8)")
```

Here we show the average mass of Northern vs Southern Hemisphere meteorites. It is interesting to see that Northern Hemisphere meteorites have a higher average mass.

## Final Analysis

> Is there any statistically significant difference in the masses of Northern vs Southern Hemisphere meteorites?

**H0: There is no difference between the masses of meteorites in the hemispheres. (avg difference 0).**


**HA: There is a difference between the masses of meteorites in the hemispheres. (avg difference != 0).**

```python
northern = df[df['hemisphere'] == 'Northern']
southern = df[df['hemisphere'] == 'Southern']

north_mass = northern['mass']
south_mass = southern['mass']

# Point Estimate
mass_pe = north_mass.mean() - south_mass.mean()
print("The point estimate is:",mass_pe)

# Degree of Freedom
deg_freedom = len(north_mass) if len(north_mass) < len(south_mass) else len(south_mass)
deg_freedom = deg_freedom - 1
print("The degrees of freedom is:",deg_freedom)

# Standard Error
north_se = north_mass.std()**2/len(north_mass)
south_se = south_mass.std()**2/len(south_mass)

mass_se = sqrt(north_se + south_se)
print("The standard error is:",mass_se)

# 5. Calculate the t score and the p-value.
mass_t = (mass_pe - 0)/mass_se
print("The t score is:",mass_t)

mass_p = stats.distributions.t.sf(mass_t,deg_freedom)
print("The p value is:",mass_p)
```

- The **point estimate** is: **32,648.79**
- The **degrees of freedom** is: **8,258**
- The **standard error** is: **10,687.52**
- The **t score** is: **3.055**
- The **p value** is: **0.001**


> Therefore, since the p-value is less than an alpha of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the masses of meteorites in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.

## Conclusion

As we can see from the analysis done above, there are some noteable points that we have learned from this dataset.

- 1998 had the highest frequency of meteorite landings, while 2013 had the least in the last three decades.

- 1937 had the highest frequency of meteorite landings, while 1901 had the least in the early 1900s.

- The distribution of masses is unimodal and highly skewed to the right with a majority of the values below 250 grams.

- Meteorites are mainly found along the 25 and -25 degree latitude lines.

- There's a general trend of meteorites landing in the western US, Southern America, Norther Africa, Southern Austrailia, and parts of Europe. Another trend that I noticed is that there seem to be less meteorites in the 2010s than in the other decades.

Thank you for reading through my project! I hope you found this dataset as fun as I did to explore. If you would like to explore further, I have even created dashboards for these datasets available below:
