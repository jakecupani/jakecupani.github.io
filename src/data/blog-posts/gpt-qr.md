Hey everyone, welcome to my blog where I share my coding adventures with you. Today I want to tell you about how I used ChatGPT to code a QR code generator in Javascript and Tailwind CSS. Yes, you read that right. ChatGPT is not only a powerful conversational AI that can chat with you about anything, but also a smart coding assistant that can help you write code in any language and framework.

Let me explain how it works. ChatGPT is a web-based chatbot that uses natural language processing and deep learning to understand your queries and generate relevant responses. You can ask it anything from trivia questions to jokes to poems. But what's really cool is that you can also ask it to write code for you. All you have to do is tell it what you want to code, what language and framework you want to use, and any other specifications or constraints. ChatGPT will then generate the code for you and show it to you in a code block.

For example, I wanted to code a QR code generator in Javascript and Tailwind CSS. A QR code is a type of barcode that can store information such as URLs, text, or contact details. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style web pages without writing custom CSS. I thought it would be fun to create a web app that lets users enter some text and generate a QR code for it.

Here's a link to the demo:
